		<p> As North Carolina’s capital city, Raleigh has it all: a thriving downtown, several notable music venues, sports teams for days, an exploding arts community and, as of late, a growing culinary scene that rivals its neighboring Southern cities—going way beyond shrimp and grits, biscuits and pimento cheese. Most visitors tend to sandwich Raleigh and Durham into one area simply because of the airport’s name, “Raleigh-Durham International Airport,” but let it be known that Raleigh has a shining personality of its own—and quite frankly, some of the most notable chefs in the South who continue to pave the way. "It's such an amazing time for food in Raleigh,” says chef Ashley Christensen. Poole's, Christensen’s first restaurant situated in downtown, will celebrate its 10-year anniversary on December 13. “In that time, we've seen a real boom of new restaurants with unique perspectives that have really enriched our community,” she adds. “It's been tremendously energizing as a chef. We used to look beyond Raleigh for inspiration—to big cities like New York or San Francisco—but these days we have so much to inspire us right within our own city."</p>

		<p>Ah – the wonderful, beautiful Triangle area. Rich in commerce, culture and higher education – there just aren’t enough superlatives to describe living here! No wonder the Triangle has been recognized as the #1 Best Place to Live. Money magazine calls Raleigh the “hottest town in the east” and Forbes gives us #2 best place for business! With such agreeable climate all year round, and fun things to do who would want to live anywhere else?</p>
